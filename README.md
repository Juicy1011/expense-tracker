## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-driven structure within the Next.js App Router.

-   `app/`: Main application directory.
    -   `/(auth)`: Route group for authentication pages (Sign In/Sign Up) handled by Clerk.
    -   `/(routes)`: Route group for protected application routes (Dashboard, Budgets, Expenses).
    -   `/_components`: Reusable components for the landing page (Header, Hero, Footer).
-   `components/ui/`: UI components from shadcn/ui (Button, Dialog, Input, etc.).
-   `db/`: Contains the Drizzle database configuration (`dbConfig.jsx`) and schema definition (`schema.ts`).
-   `lib/`: Shared utility functions.
-   `drizzle.config.ts`: Configuration file for Drizzle Kit, pointing to the database schema and credentials.
-   `middleware.ts`: Implements Clerk authentication to protect application routes.
